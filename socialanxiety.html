<br><br>Poem by me about my experience with social anxiety
</h2>

<h2>
  <font size=10><center><br>Today I closed myself in
<br>and weeped tears of sadness
<br>and loneliness
<br>No one is aware
<br>and yet life must go on
​<br>Walking down the street
<br>seeing imaginary eyes on me
<br>hearing imaginary voices talking about me
<br>My heart beating out of my chest
<br>My hands trembling out of fear
<br>making even the simplest of tasks
<br>seem like moving a mountain
<br>No one understands
<br>and yet life must go on
<br>I will overcome
<br>Maybe not today
<br>Maybe not tomorrow
​<br>But someday
</font>
