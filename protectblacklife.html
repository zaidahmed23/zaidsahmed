<br><br>Poem written by me: 24 lines, 8 syllables each</h2>
<h2>
  <font size=6><center><br>How much is black life really worth,
  <br>when they are killed for the simple
  <br>fact that they were in their own home,
  <br>they were playing with a toy in
  <br>public, they were jogging, ​they had
  <br>a hoodie on, they were selling
  <br>cigarettes, or just the fact that
  <br>they are black, In a country that
  <br>was built on their very backs four
  <br>centuries ago. A country that
  ​<br>criminalizes black people on
  <br>the sole basis of them being
  <br>black. A country that claims it gives
  <br>liberty and justice for all
  <br>even though it still has not ended
  <br>slavery as it conducts it
  <br>through a new avenue that is
  <br>the prison industrial complex.
  <br>A country that still has not paid
  <br>reparations or even came
  <br>close to acknowledging the four
  <br>centuries of oppression that
  <br>they have caused. This is a country
  <br>that has never gave real justice.</font>
